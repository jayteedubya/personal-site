# Development process

## Initialization
1. With venv active, run `django-admin startproject <project_name> <project_directory>`. This will generate a new django project.
2. cd into the newly created `<project_name>` folder and and run `python manage.py runserver` to run the server and make sure everything generated correctly. NOTE: This only happens if in the settings.py file for your app `DEBUG` is set to `True`.
